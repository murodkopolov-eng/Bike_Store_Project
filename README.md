# Sales Data Analysis – SQL Business Intelligence Project
## Project Overview
This project implements a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using SQL Server for a retail bike sales company. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights through a structured data model, KPI-focused views, and reusable stored procedures.
